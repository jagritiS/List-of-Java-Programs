3.There are certain codes which determines whether they are postive and negative if the sentence contains "not" then it is negative and if it
  doesnt contains "not" then it is positive. and also ask the user for no of sentenses for eg:

1.Create calculation between two numbers +using multiple class and constructors
2.Create student registration and display total students - using inheritance +multiple class
3.Find out prime numbers between any given range +multiple class
4.Swap any three user provided values +multiple class
5.Write a java program to compute the sum of digits of a number +multiple class
6.Find out smallest numbers from any three user given numbers +multiple class
7.Find the last 10 digit of sum series given series
1^1+2^2+3^3+4^4+.....1000^1000 = ?
answer is 9110846700
8. what is the smallest odd composite no that doesnt satisfy following
 7 = 5+2*1^2
 9  = 7 + 2*1^2
9. create an array capable of holding n integers and Modify the code in the loop so that it saves
each sequential value to its corresponding location in the array. For example, the first value must be
stored in , the second value must be stored in , and so on. for eg input is 56, 23, 12 98 then output will be
12,23,56,98
10.Remove the repeated elements in an array
for eg : array --> 10,20,2,10,34,11,20,2 output will be 10,20,2,34,11
